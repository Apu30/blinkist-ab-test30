Blinkist A/B Testing Application
Description
This application is designed to perform A/B testing for the Blinkist platform, focusing on tracking user interactions with different article variations. The primary goal is to determine which variation leads to higher user engagement, particularly in terms of clicks on the “Sign Up” button.

Features
A/B Testing Variants: Users are randomly assigned a 'control' or 'test' variation of content upon their first visit. This variation remains consistent across their subsequent visits.
Page View Tracking: Every visit to the application increments the page view count, which is tracked to measure user engagement.
Unique Click Tracking: Clicks on the “Sign Up” button are tracked. However, to ensure accuracy in measuring user engagement, only the first click from a user is counted.
Persistent Data Storage: Utilizes localStorage to store the A/B test variant, page view count, and whether the user has clicked on the “Sign Up” button. This allows for persisting data across user sessions.
Technology Stack
React: Utilized for building the user interface.
Local Storage: Used for persisting user data across sessions.
Analytics API: Custom API for logging page views and user click events.
Setup and Installation

Usage
On accessing the application, a user will be presented with either the control or test variation of the content. User interactions, such as page views and the first click on the “Sign Up” button, are tracked for analytical purposes.
